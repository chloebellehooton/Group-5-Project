## First Segment

	The topic for this project is California wildfires. My team and I will
find data in regards to California wildfires from years 2013 to 2020. With this 
data, my team will be able to predict when will the next wildfires occur in 
California for year 2021.

	For this project, the dashboard will be built by using five tools:
Pandas, Postgres, Tableau, Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), and GitHub. 
Pandas will be the tool used for data cleaning. Postgres will be the tool used for 
storage of CSV files used throughout this project. Tableau will be the tool 
used for presenting a story to viewers with visual aides to improve the 
understanding of data presented. An ERD is a tool used for this project for 
analysts working on the data to visually organize the database design of 
the project, and provide teammates expected outcome of the database table. 
Additionally, improving the communication and relationships between the flow of the 
data presented. GitHub is a tool for saving our work as we develop the 
project. GitHub will keep track of our work over time. Using these five tools 
will improve teammates communication while working on this project to 
complete the dashboard in a timely manner.  
	Data sources used to find data for this project is Kaggle.com, 
Data.gov, climate.gov, and weather.gov. 
	In regards to teams, Chloe Hooton will take on the Square role. 
Kaitlin Rockway, Merin Anto, and I will switch roles each week between 
Circle role, Triangle role, and X role to have a fair amount of work for each 
of us to complete throughout this project.

# Group-5-Project
Shared repository for group 5 final project

## Topic of the Project.
Correlation between California wildfire and weather conditions.

## Reason for Selection of Topic

California wildfires cost the US economy almost 0.7% of the countryâ€™s annual GDP , of which $45.9bn was lost outside the state,also substantial morbidity/mortality.
Predicting the frequency of fires can help with emergency planning and proactive disaster risk management.
Apart from that all four of us group mates residing at Caliornia also have equal interest and anxiety for the cause.

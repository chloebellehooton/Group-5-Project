## Overview of the Project.
Machine Learning to analyze if  California Wildfire can be predicted based on waether condition

ETL process will be performed on California wildfire dataset(extracted from kaggle) and weather dataset of the counties(extracted from : https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search)  which is recorded in wildfire dataset.

ML models RandomForestClassifier & GradientBoostingClassifier algorithms will be tested and best model will be finalized.
Also will check if  Deep Neutral Network model is feasible.

WILDFIRE Dataset has information 
1.Acres Burned
2.Personnel Involed
3.Structures Damaged
4.Structures Destroyed
5.Fatalities

These information can be used predict if its a large wildfire.

Corelating above data with weather information like Precipitaion,Temperature and Wind speed , ML will learn and predict wildfire.
